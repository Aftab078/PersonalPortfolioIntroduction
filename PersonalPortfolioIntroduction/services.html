  <h3>Web Development</h3>
   <p>Full Stack web development is a comprehensive skill set that encompasses both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development. It involves mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) on the client side. Additionally, Full Stack developers need expertise in server-side technologies such as Node.js and databases like MongoDB for handling server logic and data management. They also work with tools like Git for version control, web development frameworks like React or Angular, and various libraries and APIs. Full Stack developers are capable of creating fully functional web applications from start to finish, including designing the UI, implementing interactivity, managing data, and deploying the application to a web server. Their proficiency in both front-end and back-end development makes them versatile professionals in the field of web development</p>
